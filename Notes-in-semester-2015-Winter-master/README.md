#Notes in Semester 2015, Winter
What a f**king semester... Not only those coursework assigned during the winter holiday, but also final exams closely following Qingming Festval are disturbing us!

I made some notes on the classes I attended this semester. Sharing these notes is a mean to help each other successfully pass this final. Wish guys and me good luck.

When taking notes, I used the standard Markdown grammar, not the Github style, bucause of the restriction of my MD editor. If I had money one day, I would surely buy its PROFESSIONAL edition...

I will try my best to make sure all notes are complete, *except for the parts in the lesson I skipped on 11, March.* If I leave something important out, please tell me so that I can  fix it.

Last but not least, my notes contain these parts:

* Linux Programming
* E-business
* Business Intelligence
* Software Design and Architecture
